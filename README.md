```
$ git clone https://github.com/stiartsly/WhisperDemo-Pi.git wdemo
$ cd wdemo
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
```

or on RaspberryPi:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/stiartsly/WhisperDemo-Pi.git wdemo
$ cd wdemo
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake -DENABLE_PI=ON ..
$ make
```

## Build dependencies

Before buiding whisper demo, you have to download and build the following dependencies:

* whisper framework
* libconfuse

and copy distributions to "deps" direcotry. 

The structure of "deps" derectory should looks as listed below:

|-- deps
   |-- include
       |-- whisper.h
